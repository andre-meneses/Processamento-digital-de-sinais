# Audio processing

## Introduction 

As a part of a digital signal processing class, this project involved working with an audio file and performing the following steps:
1. Plotting the domain time signal.
2. Plotting the frequency spectrum using scipy's FFT.
3. Designing a low pass filter using the python library pyFDA.
4. Implementing the overlap-and-add method for frequency domain convolution.
5. Filtering the original audio signal using the designed filter.
6. Upsampling the resulting signal by a factor of 2 and interpolating it through the designed filter.
