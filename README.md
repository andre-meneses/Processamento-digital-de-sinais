# Audio processing

## Introduction 

This project was developed as part of a digital signal processing class. An audiofile was choosen and the following steps were executed:
1. The domain time signal was plotted. 
2. The frequency spectrum was plotted through scilab's FFT. 
3. A low pass filter was projected using python's library pyFDA.
4. The overlap-and-add method for frequency domain convolution was implemented. 
5. The original audio was filtered. 
6. The resulting signal was upsampled by a factor of 2 and then interpolated through the projected filter.
